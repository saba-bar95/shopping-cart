## Project: Shopping Cart

## This project is done as part of [Odin Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

The Shopping Cart is a web application designed to provide users with an online shopping experience. Built with React, this project allows users to browse a variety of products, add items to their cart, and manage their selections with ease. The application features a clean and intuitive interface, making it simple for users to view product details.

With functionalities such as adding and removing items from the cart, updating quantities, the Shopping Cart aims to mimic the experience of shopping in a physical store while leveraging the convenience of online shopping. This project serves as a practical demonstration of my skills in React and modern web development practices, and it is a part of my learning journey through the Odin Project.
